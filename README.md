## ‚ú® Usage

**To run a variant of the script, follow these steps:**

- Extract the **entire** `.zip` file to another folder.
- Run `OpenTerminalHere.cmd` (try to `run as admin` if nothing happens at all).
- Copy and Paste one of the lines below on your **Terminal** to unblock the scripts and execute it:

### GUI Version

```ps1
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser -Force; ls -Recurse *.ps*1 | Unblock-File; .\"WinDebloatTools.ps1"
```

<div align="center">

![Script GUI](./src/assets/script-gui.png)
_The `Apply Tweaks` button is the main one for debloating._

</div>

### **CLI Version** (Minimal, good for automation)

```ps1
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser -Force; ls -Recurse *.ps*1 | Unblock-File; .\"WinDebloatTools.ps1" 'CLI'
```

**[Scripts](./src/scripts) can be run individually, pick what you need.**

## üîÑÔ∏è Roll-Back

**If something breaks you can rely on:**

1. If you want **(almost)** everything to it's original state, use the `Undo Tweaks` button on [`WinDebloatTools.ps1`](./WinDebloatTools.ps1).
2. A restoration point done by the script itself;
3. The `Repair Windows` button on [`WinDebloatTools.ps1`](./WinDebloatTools.ps1);
